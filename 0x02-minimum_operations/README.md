# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Concepts Needed

1. Dynamic Programming:
	* Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and buildi	ng up the solution.
	* Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)

2. Prime Factorization:
	* Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the su	m of the prime factors of the target number n.
	* Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)

3. Code Optimization:
	*Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient s	olution.
	* How to optimize Python code

4. Greedy Algorithms:
	* The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
	* Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)

5. Basic Python Programming:
	* Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
	* Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)
